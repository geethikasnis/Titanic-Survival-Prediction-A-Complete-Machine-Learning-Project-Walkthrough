**Titanic Survival Prediction: A Complete Machine Learning Project Walkthrough**

This project is an end-to-end walkthrough of building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, and more. The goal is to explore the complete ML workflow, from data preprocessing to feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

**Project Overview**

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, widely used for binary classification tasks. This project demonstrates how to:

Prepare raw data for machine learning.
Engineer and encode features to improve model accuracy.
Build and evaluate predictive models using Scikit-learn.
Fine-tune hyperparameters and validate models using cross-validation.
Features
Key Objectives

**Data Preparation:**

Load training and testing datasets.
Handle missing values and outliers.
Data Visualization:
Analyze and visualize patterns and relationships in the data.

**Feature Engineering:**

Extract meaningful features from raw data, such as:
Age groups
Cabin letters
Fare quartiles
Titles extracted from names (e.g., Mr., Mrs., etc.)

**Data Encoding:**

Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using Label Encoding.

**Model Building:**

Use RandomForestClassifier for prediction.
Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

**Model Evaluation:**

Validate the model using K-Fold cross-validation.
Calculate the modelâ€™s accuracy on unseen test data.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language:
Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

**Dataset**

The project uses the Titanic dataset, which includes the following key features:
Survived: Binary target variable (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived).
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C, Q, S).
The dataset is split into:
train.csv: Used to train the machine learning model.
test.csv: Used to make predictions.

**Project Steps**

Importing Libraries and Dataset:

Load required libraries and data files.
Data Visualization:

Visualize survival rates based on various features like gender, class, and embarkation point.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Handle missing values in features like Age, Fare, and Cabin.
Extract relevant information from Name and simplify features for better interpretability.
Feature Encoding:

Standardize and encode categorical features to make them usable for machine learning algorithms.
Splitting Data:

Separate the dataset into training and validation sets for testing model performance.
Model Selection and Fine-Tuning:

Train a RandomForestClassifier.
Perform hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
Evaluate the model using accuracy scores and cross-validation.
Cross-Validation:

Use K-Fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Testing and Prediction:

Make predictions on the test dataset.
Save the output predictions in a CSV file.

**Results**

Achieved an accuracy of ~80% on the test set.
Mean accuracy across folds using K-Fold cross-validation: ~82%.
